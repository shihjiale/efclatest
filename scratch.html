    <h1>Welcome to SCRATCH!</h1>
    <p>Here we aim to create a community that thrives in Christ</p>

  <p>  SCRATCH (Students Continually Reaching And Thirsting for Christ’s Holiness) is the fellowship of high school students. The acronym used to stand for different qualities like “holiness” but was revised around 2010 to be more memorable. The current motto describes a pursuit meant for all Christians, just like ALIVE. In recent years, middle and high school have been combined on Friday nights. The middle school student coordinators who help oversee the fellowship have really benefited from awesome high school coordinators. Their planning meetings seem wild and active, but lots of fun. High school is a time to branch out, to be more established in one’s faith, as well as reaching out to others, via planning, welcoming, and even leading. Even when serving, it’s important for each student to be served, to have a solid foundation of prayer and Bible-reading. Whenever students have questions about God’s presence in their lives, or about challenges to the faith, the vision is that God loves to take in those questions, and that fellowship advisors can come alongside not only to answer questions, but to live out the process of seeking God, by going through the Word together. In addition to mentors, relationships with peers and with parents remain key. It’s never about preferring one over another, but that both are seen as supporting one’s relationship with Jesus.
